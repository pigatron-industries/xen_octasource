## Modes

Change the mode by holding down the encoder switch and turning clockwise or anticlockwise.

### 1 Phase Difference

Each output wave is the same frequency but phase shifted by 45 degrees.

Inputs:
* **SYNC**: 
* **WAVE**: The waveform generated for all outputs. Sine, Triangle, Saw or Pulse.
* **RATE**: Bipolar frequency control. The wave will be 'stopped' at the top position and moving clockwise will increase frequency. Moving anti-clockwise will decrease the frequency into the negative, which will cause the phase shifted waves to rotate in the opposite direction.
* **PHASE**: The phase difference between waves. Full clockwise will give a 1/8 phase difference so all 8 outputs give a full 360 degrees with equal spacing.
* **AMP**: Amplitude of the wave on all outputs.

Outputs:
* **OUTPUTS 1-8**: The phase shifted wave forms.
* **TRIG**: Outputs a trigger for each cycle, the same frequency as the waves.


### 2 Frequency Relationships

The frequencies of each output are different but related to each other by a frequency division.

Submodes:
1. Divide by whole numbers: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8
2. Divide by powers of 2: 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 / 64 / 128
3. Divide by various irrational numbers: 1 / zeta 3 / root 2 / phi / e / pi / feigenbaum constant / e^pi

### 3 Filter

### 4 Clock Divider

A clock source providing various subdivisions of a clock.
* Trigger: External clock (Set rate knob to 12 o'clock, if rate knob is set to higher rate than trigger then the trigger will trigger the next clock pulse early).
* Rate: Rate of internally generated clock.
* Wave: Introduces shuffle into the internal clock.
* Amplitude: A trigger pulse will cause the clock outputs rotate.

Submodes:
1. Divisions based on 24 PPQN: 1, 6, 8, 12, 24, 32, 48, 96
2. Simple Divider: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
